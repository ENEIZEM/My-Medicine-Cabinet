## Installation for Users
[At the moment, the installation APK file for Android can be downloaded from the Releases page](https://github.com/ENEIZEM/My-Medicine-Cabinet/releases)
s
Links to Google Play / App Store will appear here in the future


---

# üë®‚Äçüíª For Developers:
Node.js ‚Äî LTS (install the latest LTS version)

npm (comes with Node) or yarn (optional)

JDK 17+ (required)

Android Studio with Android SDK & Platform Tools installed (for Android builds/emulator)

adb in PATH (Android SDK platform-tools)

(Optional) macOS + Xcode + CocoaPods ‚Äî if you plan to build the iOS native part

Expo (will be used via npx expo)

For now, the app is available for testing via Expo Go.

---

### Running on Emulator / Physical Device
1) Android Emulator (Android Studio)

Open Android Studio ‚Üí AVD Manager ‚Üí create/start an emulator

Make sure adb devices shows the emulator

After npx expo prebuild, go to android/ and run:

```
# inside android directory
./gradlew installDebug
# or via Android Studio ‚Äî Run ‚Üí select device
```

---


### Physical Device

Connect the device via USB/ADB and enable USB Debugging

Run:
```
./gradlew installDebug
```

or use
```
npx expo run:android
```

(if configured)

---

### Release Build (Android)

Prepare a keystore (see "Signing" section)

In the project root:

```
npx expo prebuild        # creates android/ if not existing
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease        # .apk in android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/
# or
./gradlew bundleRelease          # .aab for Google Play in android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/
```

---


### Kotlin Native Module ‚Äî What and Where to Modify

Kotlin code is usually located in android/app/src/main/java/... or in android/<module>/src/...

If you change the native module interface, don‚Äôt forget to:

rebuild the native part (npx expo prebuild if needed, then ./gradlew assembleDebug)

update TypeScript wrappers/types in src/ so JS/TS correctly calls native methods

React Native Autolinking: modern native modules are linked automatically.
For manual linking, modify MainApplication or relevant Gradle files.

---


### Debugging and Logs
JS Logs

Use console.log() + Metro (opens when running npx expo start)

You can also use React Native Debugger or Chrome DevTools

Native Logs (Android)

In a separate terminal:

```
adb logcat
# or filter
adb logcat | grep -E "ReactNative|MyMedicineCabinet|AndroidRuntime"
```


For deeper native debugging ‚Äî set breakpoints in Android Studio and run from there.

---

### Clearing Caches
Metro:
```
npx expo start -c       # clear cache
# or
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

Gradle:
```
cd android
./gradlew clean
```

---


### Tests & Static Analysis

TypeScript: tsc --noEmit for type checking

Lint: ESLint + TypeScript rules (.eslintrc configuration)

Unit tests: Jest (recommended) ‚Äî jest + @testing-library/react-native

E2E: Detox or Appium (if needed, more complex setup)

---


### CI / CD ‚Äî Basic Recommendation (GitHub Actions)

Typical workflow steps:

checkout

setup-node + npm install (npm ci in CI)

run npm run lint, npm run typecheck, npm test

(optional) build Android debug version (./gradlew assembleDebug) for smoke testing

(optional) publish AAB to Google Play via Fastlane / EAS

If you want, I can generate an example workflow YAML for GitHub Actions.

---

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

Issue: Expo Go does not detect the native module
Cause: Expo Go does not support custom native modules ‚Üí use prebuild / dev client / custom build

"Could not find Java" / JDK errors
Check JAVA_HOME, restart terminal / Android Studio

Gradle build failed
Run ./gradlew clean ‚Üí check Kotlin/Gradle plugin version compatibility

Metro cache issues
npx expo start -c
